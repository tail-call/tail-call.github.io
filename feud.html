<H1>Feud of the Giants</H1>

<P>
Seldom have two musical giants maintained mutual disdain more
than German composer Johannes Brahms and Russian composer Pyotr
Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The men shared a birthday, May 7
(Brahms: 1833, Tchaikovsky 1840), but little more than that:
Brahms is reported to have fallen asleep during rehearsals for
Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5, while Tchaikovsky’s frustration with
the more popular Brahms frequently boiled over into outright hostility.
</P>

<P>
“I have played over the music of that scoundrel Brahms,” Tchaikovsky
wrote in his diary in 1886. “What a giftless bastard!”
</P>

<P>
“As a musical personality, he is simply antipathetic to me — I can’t
stand him. No matter how much he tries, I always remain cold and
hostile,” Tchaikovsky said in a separate letter.
</P>

<P>
While the mutual disdain does not appear to have spilled over into
personal enmity - the composers were able to enjoy dinner together
at the home of violinist Adolph Brodsky on New Year’s Day 1888 - the
gap between their musical styles is stark and authentic. Brahms was
a proponent of ‘absolute’ music - the notes on a page were reason enough
for a symphony, concerto or string quartet.
</P>

<P>
For Tchaikovsky, on the other hand, music was first-and-foremost an
emotional exercise: Celebrating Russia’s victory over Napoleon (1812 Overture),
ballet based on popular folk tales (Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker).
Even in Tchaikovsky’s “absolute” compositions, such as the fourth and
fifth symphonies or the violin concerto, the composer wears his
sleeve on his shoulder.
